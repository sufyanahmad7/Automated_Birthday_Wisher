# Automated_Birthday_Wisher

## :book: Introduction
I have forgotten some of my closest family members and friends' birthday on a few ocassions and I feel really bad about it. Therefore I have decided to write a script that automatically checks (at a set time) if today is someone's birthday. If yes, an email birthday wish (generated from 1 out of 3 email templates) will be sent. Now, I no longer have to remember everyone's birthdays.


## :computer: Tech Stack
1. Script = Python
2. Cloud hosting = PythonAnywhere (runs the script at a set time everyday)


## :white_check_mark: Key Features (App Ready)

1. An editable file containing birth dates.
2. 3 different email templates.
3. Birth date checker (checks the date today against the dates in the list).

  
## :x: Limitations

1. No GUI - have to manually hard code the birth dates.

## :runner: Future improvements

1. Work on existing limitations.
2. Can include a feature which records the birthday present bought previously. In the next year, an email reminder on the previous year's presents and gifts will be triggered concurrently but sent to self. This will remind me not to buy the same birthday present as last year.


## :bowtie: Reflections

I am intrigued how data automation can really help us save time and would like to use this technology to help my fellow colleagues at the workplace.
